# Project Title - Coconut-Factory

Arduino firmata and processing are used for this project
The game is to collect the coconut water in order to gain more points, and if collects fail, it will be losing points

## Getting Started
The final group project will be an electronic based artwork that uses a microcontroller, input sensors, and output
devices. Teams will be determined according to student interests and skill sets. Along with the creation of the
final artwork, the team will also write a paper about the conceptual and technical aspects of the project.
